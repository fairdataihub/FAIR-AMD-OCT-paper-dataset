# Dataset: FAIR AMD OCT Datasets Paper

## About
This is the dataset associated with the paper titled "Publicly Available Imaging Datasets for Age-related Macular Degeneration: Evaluation according to the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reproducible (FAIR) Principles". Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of vision loss among older adults, affects more than 200 million people worldwide. In this paper, We evaluated openly available AMD-related datasets containing optical coherence tomography (OCT) data against the FAIR principles. This repository contains the data related to our evaluation. See this [inventory](https://github.com/fairdataihub/FAIR-AMD-OCT-paper-inventory) for all related resources, including the paper.

## Standards followed
This dataset is structured according to the SPARC Data Structure v2.1 (c.f. [related manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.10.430563) and [documentation](https://docs.sparc.science/docs/navigating-a-sparc-dataset#sparc-dataset-structure)) and curated using the SPARC data curation software [SODA v15.0.2](https://github.com/fairdataihub/SODA-for-SPARC).

## Using the dataset
Simply download this repository to use the data files. Alternatively, you can download it from [Zenodo](). The main data files are in the `primary` folder. There is a `manifest.xlsx` file in that folder that describe both files. The `docs` folder contain supplementary figures associated with the paper, which are also described in the `manisfest.xlsx` file. See this [inventory](https://github.com/fairdataihub/FAIR-AMD-OCT-paper-inventory) for a link to the Jupyter notebook we developed to analyze and visualize the data.
